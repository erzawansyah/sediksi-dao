# Token-Based Reward System in SediksiDAO

## Overview

In SediksiDAO, contributors are rewarded through a token-based incentivization model. This system replaces the traditional cash rewards with a more scalable, transparent, and community-aligned method. The rewards are distributed in the form of governance tokens that hold both monetary value and voting power within the ecosystem.

## How the Reward System Works

### Earning Tokens

There are multiple ways for community members to earn tokens:
1. **Content Creation**: Contributors receive tokens when their articles are published and rated by the community.
2. **Community Engagement**: Active participation in discussions, voting, and proposal submissions are rewarded.
3. **Curation and Moderation**: Members who assist in content curation or moderation receive tokens based on their contributions.

### Staking and Yield Farming

Tokens earned can be staked within the platform to earn additional rewards. Stakers not only gain yield but also increase their voting power, aligning economic incentives with governance participation.

### Token Utility

Governance tokens in SediksiDAO have multiple utilities:
- **Voting Power**: Tokens can be used to vote on proposals and platform decisions.
- **Monetary Value**: Tokens can be traded or exchanged on supported platforms.
- **Access to Features**: Certain platform features or premium content may require holding or spending tokens.

## Distribution Mechanism

Tokens are distributed through a smart contract that ensures transparency and fairness:
1. **Reward Pool**: A portion of newly minted tokens is allocated to a reward pool, which is distributed based on contribution levels.
2. **Performance-Based Rewards**: Content that gains more engagement or votes receives higher rewards, encouraging quality contributions.
3. **Bonus Rewards**: Special campaigns or community events may offerHere’s the continuation of the content for the file **token_rewards.md** and additional files as requested:

## Governance and Staking

To align incentives with long-term platform success, SediksiDAO includes a staking mechanism that rewards long-term token holders. Staked tokens grant additional voting power and yield returns based on platform activity.

### Staking Tiers

- **Basic Staking**: Minimum staking amount with standard rewards.
- **Premium Staking**: Higher rewards with additional voting rights and access to premium features.
- **Governance Staking**: Grants exclusive governance roles and decision-making authority within the DAO.

## Conclusion

The token reward system in SediksiDAO not only incentivizes quality content and engagement but also empowers contributors with governance rights. By aligning financial and governance incentives, SediksiDAO ensures that all members have a vested interest in the platform’s growth and success.
