# Content Management System in SediksiDAO

## Overview

Content has always been at the heart of Sediksi. In transitioning to SediksiDAO, the content management system (CMS) is being reimagined to be fully decentralized, transparent, and community-driven. Below is a breakdown of how content will be published, curated, and moderated in the new system.

## Decentralized Content Publishing

The content publishing process is designed to be censorship-resistant and resilient. Articles and media are stored on decentralized networks like IPFS, ensuring that content remains accessible even if individual nodes go offline.

### Content Submission

1. **Submission Portal**: Users submit their content through a decentralized application (dApp) built on the SediksiDAO platform.
2. **Content Validation**: Before being published, content goes through a validation process to ensure it meets basic guidelines. This process is automated and supported by community validators.

### Decentralized Storage

All content is stored on IPFS or a similar decentralized storage solution. This ensures:
- **Immutability**: Once content is published, it cannot be altered or removed without community consensus.
- **Censorship Resistance**: The decentralized nature of storage ensures that no single entity can censor or control content access.

## Community-Driven Curation

Instead of relying on a centralized editorial team, SediksiDAO uses a token-based voting mechanism to curate content. The community decides which articles get featured or highlighted based on their value and relevance.

### Curation Process

1. **Content Rating**: Community members can rate content using their governance tokens.
2. **Feature Proposals**: Users can propose to feature certain content on the homepage or other prominent sections.
3. **Voting and Approval**: Proposals are voted on by the community. Approved content is then featured, providing more visibility and rewards to the creators.

## Moderation and Quality Control

Content moderation is essential for maintaining the quality and integrity of the platform. SediksiDAO uses a hybrid approach that combines automated moderation with community oversight.

### Moderation Flow

1. **Flagging System**: Community members can flag content that violates guidelines or is deemed inappropriate.
2. **Moderation Vote**: Flagged content is reviewed by a selected panel or by community vote.
3. **Consensus-Based Actions**: Based on the outcome of the vote, content can be removed, demoted, or edited according to community decisions.

## Conclusion

The decentralized content management system in SediksiDAO is built to prioritize freedom of expression while ensuring that the platform remains a high-quality, trusted space for diverse voices. By decentralizing content publishing and curation, SediksiDAO creates a more inclusive, resilient media platform.
