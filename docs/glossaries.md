# ðŸ“– SediksiDAO Glossary

This glossary provides definitions and explanations for key terms related to SediksiDAO, Web3, and decentralized governance. These terms are frequently used throughout the documentation and are essential for understanding the platformâ€™s structure and operations.

## A

- **Alternative Media**: Media outlets that provide perspectives not commonly covered by mainstream media. SediksiDAOâ€™s roots are in alternative media, offering a platform for diverse and critical viewpoints.

## B

- **Blockchain**: A decentralized digital ledger technology that records transactions across many computers in such a way that the registered information cannot be changed retroactively. SediksiDAO relies on blockchain to manage content, governance, and rewards transparently.

## C

- **Curators**: Community-elected members responsible for overseeing content quality and ensuring it aligns with SediksiDAOâ€™s values. Curators review submissions, guide discussions, and provide feedback to contributors.

- **Content Submission Process**: The sequence of steps that contributors follow to submit content for review and publication within SediksiDAO. This process includes pre-screening, community voting, and curator oversight.

- **Community Governance**: The decentralized decision-making model where all key decisions within SediksiDAO, such as content approval and platform upgrades, are made collectively by token holders through a voting mechanism.

## D

- **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**: An organization governed by smart contracts and community consensus rather than centralized management. SediksiDAO operates as a DAO, where governance and operations are managed by the community.

- **dApp (Decentralized Application)**: An application that runs on a decentralized network like Ethereum or Polygon, using blockchain technology to ensure transparency and trust. SediksiDAO is transitioning into a dApp for decentralized content management and governance.

## G

- **Governance Tokens**: Digital tokens that grant holders voting power within SediksiDAO. These tokens are used to participate in decision-making processes, propose changes, and elect curators.

## I

- **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**: A peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS is used in SediksiDAO for storing and managing content in a decentralized manner.

- **Incentivization**: The system of rewards used to encourage participation in SediksiDAO. Contributors earn tokens based on the quality and impact of their content, while active community members are rewarded for participating in governance and voting.

## M

- **Monetization**: The process of generating revenue through the platform. In SediksiDAO, monetization can involve multiple models such as token-based rewards, NFT sales, and decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations.

## S

- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Smart contracts are used in SediksiDAO to automate processes like content approval, token distribution, and voting.

## T

- **Tokenomics**: The economic model governing how tokens are issued, distributed, and used within a blockchain ecosystem. SediksiDAOâ€™s tokenomics define how governance tokens are distributed to contributors, curators, and voters.

- **Transformation Process**: The stages involved in transitioning Sediksi from a Web2 platform to a decentralized Web3 platform, including content migration, smart contract development, and user onboarding.

## V

- **Voting Mechanism**: The process by which SediksiDAO members make decisions. Governance tokens are used to cast votes on proposals, content submissions, and other key matters affecting the platform.

## W

- **Web3**: The next generation of the internet, characterized by decentralized applications (dApps), blockchain technology, and community governance. SediksiDAOâ€™s transformation into a Web3 platform enables greater transparency, resilience, and community participation.
