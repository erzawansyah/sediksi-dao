# Governance Structure of SediksiDAO

## Introduction

The governance of SediksiDAO is centered around the principles of transparency, decentralization, and community participation. The transition to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) allows Sediksi's community to directly influence the direction of the platform. Below is an overview of how the governance structure works.

## Governance Tokens

Governance in SediksiDAO is powered by a native token. Token holders have voting rights that can be used to influence key decisions, including:
- Content curation guidelines
- Platform development priorities
- Distribution of rewards and funding

### Token Distribution

Governance tokens are distributed based on contributions, staking, and community involvement. Active participation, such as creating content, voting on proposals, and engaging in community initiatives, is rewarded with tokens.

## Voting Mechanism

SediksiDAO implements a weighted voting system where token holders can vote on proposals. The voting system includes:
- **Proposal Submission**: Any token holder can submit a proposal. Proposals may include new content initiatives, changes to platform rules, or funding requests.
- **Discussion Period**: Once submitted, proposals enter a discussion phase where the community can debate the merits and potential impacts.
- **Voting Process**: After the discussion period, a voting window opens where token holders can cast their votes. The voting power is proportional to the number of tokens held.
- **Execution**: If a proposal passes the voting threshold, it is automatically executed by smart contracts.

## Governance Roles

SediksiDAO assigns specific roles to members based on their contributions and expertise:
- **Contributors**: Community members who actively produce content or participate in discussions.
- **Curators**: Responsible for moderating content and ensuring it meets the platformâ€™s standards.
- **Core Team**: Initially, a small group responsible for managing the transition to the DAO model, which will gradually relinquish control as governance becomes fully decentralized.

## Dispute Resolution

In cases of conflict or disputes within the community, SediksiDAO employs a multi-tiered resolution process:
1. **Community Voting**: For minor disputes, a simple community vote can resolve the issue.
2. **Arbitration Panel**: A selected group of experienced members may be appointed to make decisions on more complex issues.

## Conclusion

The governance structure of SediksiDAO is designed to ensure that the platform remains true to its cooperative values while leveraging the decentralization and transparency offered by blockchain technology. By empowering the community, SediksiDAO creates a fairer, more inclusive environment for content creation and curation.
