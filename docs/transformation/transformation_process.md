# Transformation Process: From Web2 to Web3

## Introduction

This document outlines the key steps in transforming Sediksi from a traditional Web2 media platform into a decentralized Web3 application using blockchain technology. The transformation is designed to be gradual, ensuring that existing users and contributors are seamlessly integrated into the new system while introducing the benefits of decentralization.

## Phase 1: Planning and Research

1. **Platform Analysis**: Assessing the current state of Sediksiâ€™s WordPress infrastructure, content workflows, and user management systems.
2. **Technology Evaluation**: Researching and selecting the most suitable blockchain technology (SUI, Move) for implementing decentralized content management and governance.
3. **Community Engagement**: Gathering feedback from existing users and contributors to ensure the transition meets the needs of the community.

## Phase 2: Content and Data Migration

1. **Decentralized Storage Integration**: Implementing decentralized storage solutions like IPFS to host existing content. The migration involves transferring articles, media, and metadata while preserving existing content quality.
2. **User Data Migration**: Transferring user accounts and profiles to a decentralized identity system. This includes ensuring that existing contributors maintain their rights and access levels.
3. **Smart Contract Deployment**: Deploying smart contracts to handle core functions like content publishing, rewards distribution, and voting.

## Phase 3: Introducing Community Governance

1. **Token Distribution**: Introducing the SediksiDAO governance token, distributing it to early contributors and existing members based on past contributions and engagement.
2. **Governance Trials**: Launching a series of governance trials to test the voting mechanisms and proposal workflows before fully decentralizing decision-making.
3. **Proposal System**: Enabling the community to submit and vote on proposals related to platform development, content curation, and reward distribution.

## Phase 4: Full Decentralization and Launch

1. **Content Curation Migration**: Moving content curation responsibilities from the centralized editorial team to the community via token-weighted voting.
2. **Platform Launch**: Officially launching SediksiDAO as a fully decentralized platform with active governance, content management, and incentivization systems in place.
3. **Onboarding New Users**: Rolling out educational resources and support for new users unfamiliar with Web3 technologies, ensuring they can participate fully in the platform.

## Conclusion

The transformation from Sediksi to SediksiDAO represents a significant evolution in how media platforms operate, prioritizing decentralization, community ownership, and resilience against censorship. By following this structured process, SediksiDAO aims to become a leading example of decentralized, cooperative media.
