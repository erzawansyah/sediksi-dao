# SediksiDAO - Overview

## Introduction

SediksiDAO is a decentralized application (dApp) that aims to transform the traditional Web2 media platform, Sediksi, into a community-governed ecosystem powered by blockchain technology. Established in 2015 as a space for alternative voices, Sediksi has always prioritized content that challenges mainstream narratives, offering a platform for thoughtful, often overlooked perspectives. With SediksiDAO, we aim to bring the cooperative principles that have always driven our mission into the decentralized world of Web3.

## Why Decentralize?

The centralized nature of current media platforms creates several challenges: limited community involvement, vulnerability to censorship, and unequal distribution of power. By transitioning to a DAO model, SediksiDAO seeks to distribute ownership, governance, and decision-making power to its community, making the platform more democratic, resilient, and scalable.

## Vision and Mission

Our vision is to build a decentralized media ecosystem where content curation and governance are in the hands of the community. We believe in empowering individuals to express their voices freely and fairly, without the constraints imposed by centralized gatekeepers.

Our mission includes:
- **Decentralized Content Management**: Implementing a blockchain-based content management system.
- **Community Governance**: Allowing users to vote on platform decisions using a token-based governance system.
- **Incentivized Contribution**: Rewarding community members with tokens for their contributions.

## Key Features of SediksiDAO

1. **Decentralized Publishing**: Articles and content are stored in a decentralized manner, using protocols like IPFS, ensuring that content remains accessible and censorship-resistant.
2. **Community-Driven Governance**: Token holders participate in decision-making through a democratic voting process.
3. **Incentivization**: Contributors are rewarded with tokens, which can be used within the ecosystem or exchanged on supported platforms.

## The Transformation Journey

The transition from Sediksi to SediksiDAO involves multiple phases:
1. **Planning and Development**: Laying the foundation by building a modular system that integrates blockchain-based content management and governance.
2. **Community Involvement**: Gradually introducing governance features that allow the community to participate in decision-making.
3. **Full Migration**: Moving all key operations, including content publishing and monetization, to the decentralized platform.

## Conclusion

SediksiDAO aims to be more than just a media platform; it seeks to redefine how media can be governed, managed, and monetized in the age of decentralization. By leveraging the principles of cooperative ownership and the power of Web3, we envision a future where every voice is heard, and every member has a stake in the platformâ€™s success.
