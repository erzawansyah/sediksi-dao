# üåê Overview of SediksiDAO - Decentralized Voices

## Introduction
SediksiDAO - Decentralized Voices is a project designed to transition Sediksi from a Web2-based media platform into a Web3-based decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This transformation aims to align Sediksi‚Äôs core values with cooperative principles, ensuring that content creation, curation, and platform governance are managed collectively by the community.

## Vision ‚ú®
The vision of SediksiDAO is to create a decentralized platform where every voice is valued equally. Our goal is to provide a democratic space for alternative perspectives, promoting diverse and critical discussions that are often missing in mainstream media. By leveraging the power of Web3, SediksiDAO seeks to decentralize not just content, but also the decision-making process, making it fairer and more inclusive.

## Core Principles üå±
1. **Community-Driven Governance**: SediksiDAO operates on a token-based governance model where members collectively make key decisions about the platform‚Äôs direction, content curation, and community rules.
2. **Decentralized Content Management**: Content is stored and managed in a decentralized way using blockchain technology, ensuring resilience and reducing reliance on centralized servers.
3. **Cooperative Ideals**: Following cooperative principles, SediksiDAO ensures that every contributor, from writers to curators, has an equal voice in the platform's operations.

## Project Goals üéØ
- **Empower Alternative Voices**: Continue Sediksi's tradition of amplifying underrepresented perspectives by giving every community member a stake in the platform.
- **Transition to Web3**: Build a fully decentralized application (dApp) that integrates blockchain technology for content management, governance, and incentivization.
- **Sustainable Incentivization**: Replace the current cash-based reward system with a tokenized model that aligns more closely with cooperative values and ensures long-term sustainability.

## Road Ahead üöÄ
The journey to decentralization involves several key phases, each requiring careful planning and execution. This documentation serves as a roadmap, guiding the Sediksi community through every step of the transformation process.
