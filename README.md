# ![Sediksi Logo](https://sediksi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Logo-Baru-Sediksi.png) SediksiDAO - Decentralized Voices

Welcome to the **SediksiDAO - Decentralized Voices** repository! This documentation outlines the vision, goals, and structure of SediksiDAO, an initiative transforming Sediksi from a traditional media platform into a decentralized application (dApp) governed by its community.

## Introduction and Vision ✨

SediksiDAO’s mission is to create a decentralized platform where contributors can follow a clear path to becoming curators. These curators are essential in ensuring high-quality content and intentional voting that aligns with Sediksi's values. Our goal is to empower community members to have a meaningful impact on content curation and platform decisions.

> **Important Note**: This repository contains **only documentation**. There are no code files available yet, and the framework or tech stack has not been determined. Therefore, you won’t find a “Getting Started” section here. This documentation focuses on the project's vision, structure, and challenges as Sediksi transitions into a Web3 platform.

## Current State 📈

Sediksi is a well-established platform with hundreds of active contributors and a dedicated editorial team. Our primary content consists of **Opini** (opinion pieces) and light-themed **News Features**, offering alternative perspectives that are often underrepresented in mainstream media.

Currently, Sediksi runs on a WordPress-based system with custom features such as **Custom Post Types (CPTs)** and **Custom Fields**. These features have enabled us to scale while maintaining the unique style and voice of our content.

## Origin of the Name "Sediksi" 📜

The name “Sediksi” is derived from the Indonesian words *se* (which means "a" or "one") and *diksi* (which means "word" or "phrase"). The name symbolizes the power of a single word in shaping perspectives, driving narratives, and sparking critical conversations.

This aligns perfectly with Sediksi's mission as a platform that amplifies alternative voices and diverse perspectives—often starting with just a single word or phrase that challenges mainstream narratives. SediksiDAO carries this spirit forward by decentralizing content creation and governance, ensuring that every member’s voice is equally valued, just like a single word can hold immense significance in communication.

## Transformation Challenges 🚧

Transitioning Sediksi to a decentralized model presents several challenges:

- **Integrating New Curators**: Onboarding curators is crucial to maintaining content quality and ensuring that voting decisions are intentional and align with Sediksi's values. High-quality onboarding and training will be essential in this transformation.
- **Resource Allocation for Initial Curators**: In the early stages, we plan to strategically allocate resources to incentivize initial curators, ensuring that they have the tools and support needed to succeed and grow the platform.

## Future Development Opportunities 🎨

SediksiDAO envisions expanding the platform beyond just writers to include diverse creative contributors, such as:

- **Graphic Designers and Illustrators**: Collaborating to create visual assets for Opini content, making articles more engaging and visually appealing.
- **Photographers**: Providing high-quality images as assets to enhance the overall presentation of articles.
- **Comic Artists and Visual Storytellers**: Contributing comics and visual narratives that align with SediksiDAO’s mission, offering more varied content formats.
- **Decentralized Creative Marketplaces**: Potentially introducing a decentralized marketplace where creatives can offer services or collaborate on projects within the SediksiDAO ecosystem, all while being compensated in tokens.

These developments not only enhance content diversity but also align with SediksiDAO’s cooperative principles by offering more inclusive participation options.
