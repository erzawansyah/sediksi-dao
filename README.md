# SediksiDAO - Decentralized Voices

Welcome to the SediksiDAO repository! This project is focused on transforming Sediksi, an alternative media platform, into a decentralized application (dApp) that aligns with cooperative principles and the ethos of Web3. SediksiDAO aims to create a platform where content is managed and curated by the community, ensuring that every voice is heard and valued equally.

## Introduction

SediksiDAO - Decentralized Voices is a project aimed at transitioning Sediksi, a Web2-based media platform founded in 2015, into a Web3-based decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Sediksi has served as a platform for alternative voices and diverse perspectives, focusing on topics that are often underrepresented in mainstream media.

### Vision and Goals

- **Decentralized Content Management**: A blockchain-based system that stores and manages Opini articles and other content in a decentralized way, removing the need for centralized control.
- **Community Governance**: Implementing a token-based governance system where users vote on key decisions, such as content curation and platform development.
- **Incentivized Contribution**: Contributors earn tokens based on their participation, replacing the current cash reward system with a tokenized model that aligns with cooperative values.
